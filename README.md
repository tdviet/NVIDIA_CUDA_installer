NVIDIA_CUDA_installer

This script will download install NVIDIA driver and CUDA runtime libraries on your virtual machine with Ubuntu. Be sure to check correct driver for your GPGPU at http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx and approve the license. Do not install full CUDA if you not really need it, that will download a large amount of data and take a long time to install.
